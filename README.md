# MinicraftCE

IMPORTANT: this project is still under construction

A custom version of minicraft for your TI-84 plus CE calculator.

To install the game on your calculator, you will need to have [TI connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) and you also need to install the [CE C 'Standard' Libraries](https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/).
